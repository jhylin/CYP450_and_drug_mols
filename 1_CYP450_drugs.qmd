Something about drug toxicology.

Seems to involve (in a very rough sense) 3 main types: structural alerts (in relation to known adverse effects or PAINs), Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. There are most likely more as well (need to look further into).

Recent commentary that mentions about "avoidome" - "Structure is beauty, but not always truth" (cite: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.01.003) talks about DMPK-related proteins to avoid 
- also mentioned two other blog posts which have reviewed this commentary recently (interesting view points)
- https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/john-keats-would-word - D. Lowe
- https://fbdd-lit.blogspot.com/2024/03/ - P. Kenny

Many have looked into structural alerts (one example repo - rd_filters). ChEMBL database also has a cheminformatic utils web service that provides structural alert computation for compounds. There are most likely many more (probably need to search for more).

hERG potassium channel is also another frequently-looked aspect for drug toxicology due to its effect on cardiac QT prolongation.

CYP450 enzymes also play a key role in the toxicology part of ADMET process of therapeutic drugs, I thought to look into the relationship between CYP450 and small drug molecules initially to see if there is anything interesting for further explorations.

##### **Extracting data**

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import chembl_downloader
from chembl_downloader import latest
```

```{python}
# Latest version of ChEMBL
latest_version = latest()
print(f"The latest ChEMBL version is: {latest_version}")
```

I'm using SQL via chembl_downloader again to download approved drugs with their ChEMBL ID and equivalent canonical SMILES. All of the CYP3A4 inhibitors extracted from ChEMBL are based on the [Flockhart table of drug interactions](https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx).

A bit about retrieving data here, the following might not be the best way to get the data, but I've somehow incorporated chembl_downloader into my own small piece of function code to retrieve SMILES of approved drugs. Earlier on, I was repeating SQL queries and thought to improve them by using a function code instead - see Python script named as "cyp_drugs.py". It removes a large chunk of SQL query string every time when trying to get different CYP inhibitors, leaving only approved drug names so it's easier to read and understand.

Another possible way is to use get_target_sql(), e.g. using a specific CYP enzyme as the protein target to retrieve data, but it appears that there are no clear data marked to indicate the potency of CYP inhibition or induction (i.e. weak, moderate or strong) in the ChEMBL database (an example link for CYP2D6 in ChEMBL - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/web_components/explore/activities/STATE_ID:pxs_ydUxNelxmAa9ckYEPw%3D%3D). The Flockhart table has clearly annotated each approved drug with journal paper citations, so I'm going to stick the following method for now.

```{python}
## Main issue previously was with sql string - too many quotation marks!
# e.g. WHERE molecule_dictionary.pref_name = '('KETOCONAZOLE', 'FLUCONAZOLE')'': near "KETOCONAZOLE": syntax error
# Resolved by adding string methods e.g. strip() and replace() to sql query string
# function code used chembl_downloader code as reference since it has no particular function to select drugs this way yet
from cyp_drugs import chembl_drugs

# Get a list of strong cyp3a4 inhibitors
# and save as a tsv file
df_3a4_strong_inh = chembl_drugs(
    "CERITINIB", "CLARITHROMYCIN", "DELAVIRIDINE", "IDELALISIB", "INDINAVIR", "ITRACONAZOLE", "KETOCONAZOLE", "MIBEFRADIL", "NEFAZODONE", "NELFINAVIR", "RIBOCICLIB", "RITONAVIR", "SAQUINAVIR", "TELAPREVIR", "TELITHROMYCIN", "TUCATINIB", "VORICONAZOLE",
    #file_name="strong_3a4_inh"
    )
df_3a4_strong_inh
```

```{python}
## Get a list of moderate cyp3a4 inhibitors
# skipping grapefruit juice as it's not quite an approved drug...
# note: amlodipine inhibits cyp3a5
df_3a4_mod_inh = chembl_drugs(
    "AMLODIPINE", "APREPITANT", "CIPROFLOXACIN", "CRIZOTINIB", "DILTIAZEM", "ERYTHROMYCIN", "FLUCONAZOLE", "IMATINIB", "LETERMOVIR", "NETUPITANT", "VERAPAMIL", #file_name="mod_3a4_inh"
    )
df_3a4_mod_inh
```

```{python}
# Get a list of strong cyp2d6 inhibitors
df_2d6_strong_inh = chembl_drugs(
    "BUPROPION", "FLUOXETINE", "PAROXETINE", "QUINIDINE", 
    #file_name="strong_2d6_inh"
    )
df_2d6_strong_inh
```

```{python}
# Get a list of moderate cyp2d6 inhibitors
df_2d6_mod_inh = chembl_drugs(
    "ABIRATERONE", "CINACALCET", "CLOBAZAM", "DOXEPIN", "DULOXETINE", "HALOFANTRINE", "LORCASERIN", "MOCLOBEMIDE", "ROLAPITANT", "TERBINAFINE", 
    #file_name="mod_2d6_inh"
    )
df_2d6_mod_inh
```

Initially, four categories of approved drugs are retrieved - strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, moderate CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, strong CYP2D6 inhibitors and moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors.

This group of drugs inhibiting CYP3A4/5 is the largest cohort of all the cytochrome inhibitors. When a drug behaves like a cytochrome inhibitor, it inhibits the activity of a particular cytochrome enzyme e.g. CYP3A4 leading to a reduction of clearance of a particular therapeutic drug e.g. a CYP3A4 substrate such as apixaban, thus increasing its plasma concentration in vivo causing higher chance of adverse effect (which in the context of apixaban, this means the poor person who's taken apixaban may get excessive bleeding!).

##### **Import and preprocess data**

* Will look at the two largest group of CYP inhibitors first (may need to include substrates and inducers too - depends on how this will go...)

* Any interesting molecular motifs/substructures?

```{python}
# Using pandas 2.2.2, numpy 2.0.0 and rdkit 2024.3.1 (all latest versions)

# Seems to work as a new df is generated but with some error messages shown though
# ---error message---
# A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
# NumPy 2.0.0 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
# versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
# Some module may need to rebuild instead e.g. with 'pybind11>=2.12'.

# If you are a user of the module, the easiest solution will be to
# downgrade to 'numpy<2' or try to upgrade the affected module.
# We expect that some modules will need time to support NumPy 2.


# ?try using pip-tools to see if it helps

# preprocess canonical smiles 
from mol_prep import preprocess
df_3a4_strong_inh = df_3a4_strong_inh.copy()
df_3a4_strong_inh_p = df_3a4_strong_inh.apply(preprocess, axis=1)
df_3a4_strong_inh_p
```


```{python}
# or convert the canonical_smiles into rdkit mols independently (not using preprocess function) 
# PandasTools
# Check structure validities
```
