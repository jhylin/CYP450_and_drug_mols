Something about drug toxicology.

Seems to involve (in a very rough sense) 3 main types: structural alerts (in relation to known adverse effects or PAINs), Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. There are most likely more as well (need to look further into).

Recent commentary that mentions about "avoidome" - "Structure is beauty, but not always truth" (cite: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.01.003) - DMPK-related proteins to avoid

Many have looked into structural alerts (one example repo - rd_filters). ChEMBL database also has a cheminformatic utils web service that provides structural alert computation for compounds. There are most likely many more (probably need to search for more).

hERG potassium channel is also another frequently-looked aspect for drug toxicology due to its effect on cardiac QT prolongation.

CYP450 enzymes also play a key role in the toxicology part of ADMET process of therapeutic drugs, I thought to look into the relationship between CYP450 and small drug molecules initially to see if there is anything interesting for further explorations.

##### **Extracting data**

```{python}
import chembl_downloader
from chembl_downloader import latest
```

```{python}
# Latest version of ChEMBL
latest_version = latest()
print(f"The latest ChEMBL version is: {latest_version}")
```

I'm using SQL via chembl_downloader again to download approved drugs with their ChEMBL ID and equivalent canonical SMILES. All of the CYP3A4 inhibitors extracted from ChEMBL are based on the [Flockhart table of drug interactions](https://drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu/MainTable.aspx).

```{python}
sql = """
SELECT
    MOLECULE_DICTIONARY.chembl_id,
    MOLECULE_DICTIONARY.pref_name,
    MOLECULE_DICTIONARY.max_phase,
    COMPOUND_STRUCTURES.canonical_smiles
FROM MOLECULE_DICTIONARY
JOIN COMPOUND_STRUCTURES ON MOLECULE_DICTIONARY.molregno == COMPOUND_STRUCTURES.molregno
WHERE molecule_dictionary.pref_name IN ("CERITINIB", "CLARITHROMYCIN", "DELAVIRIDINE", "IDELALISIB", "INDINAVIR", "ITRACONAZOLE", "KETOCONAZOLE", "MIBEFRADIL", "NEFAZODONE", "NELFINAVIR", "RIBOCICLIB", "RITONAVIR", "SAQUINAVIR", "TELAPREVIR", "TELITHROMYCIN", "TUCATINIB", "VORICONAZOLE")
"""

# default query uses the latest ChEMBL version
df_3a4_inh = chembl_downloader.query(sql)
#df.to_csv(..., sep='\t', index=False)
df_3a4_inh
```

###### **Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5**

This group of drugs inhibiting CYP3A4/5 is the largest cohort of all the cytochrome inhibitors. When a drug behaves like a cytochrome inhibitor, it inhibits the activity of a particular cytochrome enzyme e.g. CYP3A4 leading to a reduction of clearance of a particular therapeutic drug e.g. a CYP3A4 substrate such as apixaban, thus increasing its plasma concentration in vivo causing higher chance of adverse effect (which in the context of apixaban, this means the poor person who's taken apixaban may get excessive bleeding!).
