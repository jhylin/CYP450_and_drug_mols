Something about drug toxicology.

Seems to involve (in a very rough sense) 3 main types: structural alerts (in relation to known adverse effects or PAINs), Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. There are most likely more as well (need to look further into).

Recent commentary that mentions about "avoidome" - "Structure is beauty, but not always truth" (cite: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.01.003) - DMPK-related proteins to avoid

Many have looked into structural alerts (one example repo - rd_filters). ChEMBL database also has a cheminformatic utils web service that provides structural alert computation for compounds. There are most likely many more (probably need to search for more).

hERG potassium channel is also another frequently-looked aspect for drug toxicology due to its effect on cardiac QT prolongation.

CYP450 enzymes also play a key role in the toxicology part of ADMET process of therapeutic drugs, I thought to look into the relationship between CYP450 and small drug molecules initially to see if there is anything interesting for further explorations.

## Trialling chembl_web_resource client
## if not suitable, probably back to chembl_downloader or other ways

# Trying to get some chemical structures of approved drugs
from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client

molecule = new_client.molecule
mols = molecule.filter(pref_name__iexact='aspirin').only('molecule_structures')
mols
```

```{python}
type(mols)
```
